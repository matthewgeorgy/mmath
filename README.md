As mentioned in the description, this is my C99 header-only/matrix vector math library.
It's fully comptabile with OpenGL 4+ and likely has some compatibility with OpenGL 3 assuming that it treats vectors/matrices the same way as version 4+.

The immediate question is: why write your own library? There are already math libraries out there, so why not use those?
This is a reasonable question, and the answer has quite a few parts to it.

## 1. Support for C
Simply put, GLM, one of the more commonly used libraries, is also header-only, but it is only compatible with C++. One of the most confusing things I faced when first
discovering OpenGL was the fact that I never saw a single tutorial/guide/reference that covered OpenGL using C, despite the fact that OpenGL is a C API. The reason for this, as I have come to learn, is that most of these resources use GLM as their vector/matrix math library, which immediately forces you to use C++ whether you like it or not. It also doesn't help that GLM, reasonably so, uses C++ features, ie, classes, namespaces, operator/function overloading, and templates (ESPECIALLY templates - I'll get to these later). As a result, you really don't have a choice when it comes to what language to use if you choose to use GLM. Now of course you can always just opt to write C-style C++, but the limitation on what language you have to use is still present.

## 2. GLM's size
GLM is a VERY big library which makes sense because it supports other mathematical constructs, such as complex numbers and quaternions. So what's the price you have to pay for this extensive (and in my case, unneccessary) support? 400+ files! That's right, GLM contains over 400 files. Many of these files are completely unneccessary in my case because I don't need support for many of the mathematical constructs that GLM provides, as well as the fact that many of these files are either i) empty  ii) FILLED with blank declarations  iii) just more #includes! The result? Increased compile times and a polluted output console when compiling. In all fairness, the compile times aren't TOO much longer and the output console isn't TOO polluted, but these negative side effects don't carrry any silver linings with them unfortunately, so I consider these to be unacceptable.

## 3. GLM's complexity and template abuse
These two points tie together so I will address them as one. Simply put, GLM has some of the ugliest C++ template abuse I've ever seen, and I encourage anyone reading this to open up the GLM source code and just have a read through the code. There truly are templates everywhere, and it makes the code very complex and difficult to read and understand. It also doesn't help that the documentation for GLM leaves a lot to be desired, which makes it hard to understand what the functions do if you don't understand the math behind them. Furthermore, in my opinion, the use of templates in this kind of library doesn't really make sense. 

The whole point of C++ templates is to write functionality with generic typing so that you don't need to rewrite the same code several times to accomodate different data types. This is of course a nice feature for C++ to have, but the use of it in a vector/matrix math library is pointless. Templates implies that you want flexibility in what types to use for vectors/matrices... but the only type you should be using are floats/doubles anyway! You will be doing lots of mathematical calculations with your vectors/matrices, so you need the "precision" (and by precision, I really just mean a few decimal places) that floats/doubles provide. These are the only two types that you should be using, so the point of implementing templates into this library in the first place doesn't even make sense. Go ahead and write a 3D program and use int vectors instead of float vectors, but don't be surprised when you see distortion, artifacting, and unwanted visual effects due to the loss of precision. So what's the result of abusing templates in this way? Unneccessary library complexity, additional compile-time overhead, and difficulty in understanding the functionality of the library - all with no silver linings. Again, I encourage anyone reading this to actually have a look at the source code for GLM and see for yourself what I'm talking about.

Now, there is another library called CGLM that addresses many of the issues I've outlined above: it's written in C, it's much smaller and conciser, and it's easier to understand. However, there is still additional, unneccessary overhead in my opinion, and it supports a lot more mathematical constructs that I don't need. But regardless of these improvements that CGLM makes, it will NEVER change the final reason I have below.

## 4. Do it yourself
I like writing C code, and I find the idea of developing my own tools/libraries as something very fun. As of writing this, I've had a lot of fun developing this library over the past few weeks, as well as the joy of seeing it work perfectly whenver I test it. It's taught me a lot about how to design, write, and optimize tools like this, which I think is a very valuable skill for any programmer. It's also nice knowing that I've developed something that I can actually implement into future projects, and I take great pride in the work that I've done, especially considering that this is the first tool/lib I've ever written.
